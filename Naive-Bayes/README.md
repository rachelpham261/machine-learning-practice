# Spam Email Classification wih Naive Bayes

This repository implements the Naive Bayes algorithm for classifying spam/non-sample emails. The code for processing the data, feature extraction, training, and testing is included in the notebook `naive_bayes.ipynb`.

## Usage
Unzip `data.zip` and place the `train-mails` and `test-mails` directories on the same directory as the notebook file. Run the code cells in `naive_bayes.ipynb` sequentially to read the data, process the data, extract features and labels, train the Naive Bayes model, and test the model.

## Required packages
The code requires `numpy` for processing data, and `sklearn` for the implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm and accuracy score calculation.

## Software/Library versions
- Python: 3.11.5
- Numpy: 1.26.3
- Sklearn: 1.2.2
