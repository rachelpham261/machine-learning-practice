# Income Classification With Decision Tree

This repository implements the Decision Tree algorithm for classifying individuals into 2 income categories, > 50K and < 50K. The code for processing the data, training, evaluation, hyperparameter tunining, and visualization is included in the notebook `decision_tree.ipynb`.

## Usage

Run the code blocks in `decision_tree.ipynb` sequentially for data understanding and processing, training, evaluating the model with various metrics, hyperparameter tunining, and visualizing the best tree found.

## Required packages
The code requires `pandas` for reading and processing data and `sklearn` for the implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm and metric calculation. `seaborn` and `matplotlib` are also needed for visualization.

## Software/Library versions
- Python: 3.11.5
- Pandas: 1.26.3
- Sklearn: 1.2.2
- Seaborn: 0.13.1
- Matplotlib: 3.8.0
