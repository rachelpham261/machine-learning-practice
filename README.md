# Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains four projects, each focusing on a specific machine learning algorithm and its application to real-world data. The projects cover Naive Bayes for spam email detection, Decision Trees for income classification, Ensemble Methods for improved prediction accuracy, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for movie recommendation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Spam Email Classification with Naive Bayes (`Naive-Bayes`)
Implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails. It involves processing the data, extracting features, and evaluating the model's performance.

- **Python Notebook**: `naive_bayes.ipynb`
- **Key Libraries**: numpy, sklearn

### 2. Income Classification with Decision Tree (`Decision-tree`)
Application of the Decision Tree algorithm to classify individuals into two income categories using census data. The project includes data preprocessing, model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization.

- **Python Notebook**: `decision_tree.ipynb`
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib

### 3. Income Classification with Ensemble Methods (`Ensemble-methods`)
Exploration of various ensemble methods, such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGB, to classify income levels. It focuses on training, model evaluation, and hyperparameters tuning.

- **Python Notebook**: `ensemble.ipynb`
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, sklearn, xgboost, seaborn, matplotlib

### 4. Movie Recommendation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (`KNN`)
Development of a Movie Recommender System using the KNN algorithm, demonstrating similarity-based recommendations. The project includes data loading, EDA, model fitting, and implementation.

- **Python Notebook**: `knn.ipynb`
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, sklearn, matplotlib

## Installation and Setup

Python is required for running these projects. After cloning the repository, install the necessary libraries with:

```
pip install numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
```

Datasets must be placed in their specified directories as detailed in each project's README. Open the project Python notebooks in Jupyter to run the analyses.

## Dataset
